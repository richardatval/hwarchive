      <h3 class="accordion-header">Many children benefit from Sensory Integration Therapy from the Occupational Therapy service. This therapy is very difficult to access. How are LPT going to alter their funding so that more children can be seen?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Children’s services within Leicestershire Partnership Trust have never been commissioned to provide sensory integration therapy, which is a specific form of assessment and treatment for people with sensory processing difficulties. Sensory integration is normally provided by therapists’ predominantly occupational therapists. In order to practice you need to have attended an accredited post graduate course, completion at the highest level is a Masters qualification. Currently the service has 2 fully qualified therapists and 4 who have the basic requirement. </p>
<p>General sensory assessments have been completed (and still are) to assist with differential diagnosis in both the CAMHS services and Occupational Therapy Service.</p>
<p>In 2011/2012 the Occupational Therapy Service requested additional funding to deliver a sensory integration service and the commissioners initiated a consultation period including a stakeholder event.  At the end of this consultation the request for additional funding was rejected and the following statement was issued by the commissioners:</p>
<p>STATEMENT ON SENSORY PROCESSING DIFFICULTIES AND SENSORY INTEGRATION THERAPY</p>
<p>FAMILY, YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN CLINICAL SUB-GROUP</p>
<p>The Family, Young People and Children Clinical Sub-Group has considered a request to commission sensory integration therapy from Leicestershire Partnership Trust. The Group has investigated the research evidence for this therapy and received representations from clinicians and parents.</p>
<p>The Group has concluded that there is insufficient evidence that sensory integration therapy is a clinically effective intervention which should be commissioned as a stand-alone service. This is based on a review of research evidence including analysis conducted by the American Academy of Paediatrics in 2011.</p>
<p>Sensory integration therapy has never been commissioned by health services in Leicester City, Leicestershire or Rutland. Health services do commission an occupational therapy service for children and young people based on national guidance, local need and financial constraint.</p>
<p>December 2012</p>
<p>Following this consultation the Occupational Therapy Service decided that they would be able to provide advice to families, where sensory processing difficulties affecting every day function were identified or suspected that would support families finding their own strategies to support the child.  After consultation with parents it was decided that a parent workshop would be useful.  Parent workshops have been delivered and developed based on feedback from parents and now consists of a 3-hour workshop delivered to 12 parents at a time.  Each family is offered 2 places. We currently deliver 3 sessions a month and on average support 24 children.  At the end of the session the families receive a pack of information including 2 books that are specially imported from America that are written for parents to support their child.  After 8 weeks of following these strategies parents are offered the opportunity to phone in to talk to a therapist who will be able to offer further advice.</p>
<p>If at any point a child is identified who would benefit from the mainstream Occupational Therapy Service then this service is offered and may include a detailed assessment, individual or group therapy, school visit or the provision of equipment.</p>        </div>

          <p>In particular, when are they going to sort the situation in Charnwood where it is virtually impossible to get a CAMHS referral, no matter how seriously ill the child, because of a lack of clinicians?</p>
<p>Most of our resource is directed to the acute children and young people who are seen on the day of referral or urgent cases who receive an assessment within 2 weeks. Some children, who have been screened as meeting the criteria for a routine assessment, wait from between 13 weeks to a maximum of 44 weeks to be seen. This means that on average a child waits around 8 weeks to be seen. </p>
<p>Criteria for acceptance of a referral into specialist CAMHS is specific, and includes psychiatric presentation. We are the only service for patients with diagnosable mental illness, and must prioritise this function.</p>
<p>Outpatient CAMHS are engaged in service redesign work to bring down waiting times and ensure input is provided at the time of clinical need.</p>        </div>

          <p>The responsibility for the emotional health and wellbeing of young people lies with everyone who works with children and young people.  Schools and partner agencies provide much of the pastoral and behavioural support. It has been noticeable during that last 18 months that some areas of counselling provision have been decommissioned e.g. Open Door in the City. In other areas such as Loughborough, school based projects such as Worth-it have been established to provide counselling support for students. School nurses will be able to signpost young people to their local early help offer. GP’s can also advise/refer for counselling. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specialist CAMHS has limited capacity to deliver specific therapies, and often services have therapies that would be evidence based as dictated by NICE guidance, for specific conditions.</p>
<p>We hope that the information contained in these websites will be useful. </p>

    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) initially contribute to the diagnosis of ASD, especially where cases are complicated by Mental health elements.</p>
<p>Primarily these include children of secondary school age as primary age children will be seen by a Community Paediatrician. Speech and Language Therapists and/or Psychologists are also involved in diagnosis.</p>
<p>Following assessment, and possible diagnosis, CAMHS provides support and treatment options for the emotional health components of the diagnosis including; depression and anxiety etc. The service provides some psychoeducational input in individual and group settings, which will be determined in partnership with the family. Speech and Language Therapy and Occupational Therapy may be involved in the delivery of a treatment programme which may be set out in the individuals Education, Health and Care Plan</p>
<p>CAMHS can also assess motor sensory functioning and offer advice and short-term support in understanding the impact of sensory functioning on a child.</p>
<p>Due to the volume of assessments that are required LPT are not able to provide comprehensive post diagnostic support. Initially Autism outreach can offer targeted support to families and schools, along with support in understanding the impact of the diagnosis.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The dietetic service is funded and resourced to provide a service Monday to Friday with core hours being 9am to 5pm, dietetic staff work flexibly between 8am and 8pm Monday to Friday to meet patient and service needs e.g. early morning and evening Multi Disciplinary Team outpatient clinics, early morning and evening board rounds and also undertake a lot of work in the evenings and weekends with local patient support groups e.g. diabetes coeliac, cancer, Gastrointestinal disease.</p>
<p>We are not aware of any near misses, incidents or complaints linked to there being no dietetic service provision at the weekends to date. A lot of ward Dieticians will leave care plans for weekends predicting patient journeys and progress and work late on Fridays to do this.</p>
<p>We have identified with adult surgery – cancer cases that with a Saturday service post ward rounds we could help with more effective discharge and we are working with the Clinical Management team to identify resource needs for this.</p>
<p>As part of working towards 7 day working we have undertaken a granular level review of the need for weekend working at speciality and sub speciality level and working with each Clinical Management Group on this.</p>
<p>We have also worked with other Trusts Dietetic Services to look at their experiences in implementing 7 days services and some have more recently reported that this has destabilised their service overall with time owed being taken in core service delivery time reducing patient care in critical areas such as gastroenterology and renal where the dietician is core to the Multi Disciplinary Team.</p>
<p>We looked closely at provision of weekend and bank holiday dietetic services over this Christmas and New year and concluded we would not put any in as time owed would be taken in the weeks following in January when peak patient activity was expected. On review of this decision with all dietetic staff in the new year this was the correct decision and no patient care was compromised.</p>
<p>We continue to keep this issue under review and have prioritised the need to develop clinical guidelines and policies for all health care professionals in nutrition and diet care and provide training as well to support their use in the clinical areas.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">How does UHL provide support to meet the needs of patients who require Learning Disability Nurses out of hours?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The majority of patients that are seen by the Learning Disability (LD) Service are in fact admitted during the week and within working hours. This is on average 3 new patients per day Mon - Friday. Out of hours admissions are less than this. Any patient admitted over the weekend or after 5pm is identified by the team via our flagging system which is checked daily. The care of the patient and level of support required is prioritised according to their particular needs.</p>
<p>Once the initial needs assessment is carried out ward staff manage a significant number of patients with a learning disability without needing on going daily support from the specialist team.</p>
<p>A major part of the role of the Acute Liaison Nurses has been to work closely with ward staff and share their expertise to enable all staff to provide the appropriate care to patients with a learning disability in the initial phase of their patient journey. The team do provide staff training throughout the year.</p>
<p>There is a specific needs assessment document that we ask patients / carers who have a learning disability to complete and bring with them when they come into hospital (The traffic Light Assessment and Emergency Grab Sheet). These documents include basic information about the individual requirements of the patients i.e. preferred method of communication, dietary needs, medication, sources of anxiety etc. This is enormously helpful for ward staff and enables them to provide the appropriate support that the patient needs.</p>
<p>The staffing resource for the service remains under review and with the advent of 7 day working the Trust will revisit the level of service provision.</p>
<p>If service users and or carers feel that they haven't had sufficient access to the Acute Liaison Nurse Service because the admission occurred out of hours the Manager of the service would be keen to hear from you.</p>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>We offer a service for chronic pain patients to access our chronic pain nurses - not specifically for fibromyalgia, but they will ring patients back and do telephone consultations.</p>
<p>Fibromyalgia is a neurological diagnosis that comes from many sources not usually diagnosed in the pain clinic. Usually diagnosed by the rheumatology service where leaflets are given. No specific information is given in the pain clinic.</p>
<p>It is a diagnosis of exclusion where all other pain, joint pain, back etc. are ruled out. At this point the patient can be referred to pain clinic after being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>If a patient was referred to the pain service without a diagnosis but had wide spread joint pain the service would discharge to rheumatology for tests and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Once within the pain service a patient with a fibromyalgia diagnosis is prescribed medication, which would typically be pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine etc. whilst avoiding opiates. Intravenous lidocaine infusions were tried in the past, however this was found to have no long term benefits.</p>
<p>There is no cure and very few medications show success. Fibromyalgia is usually treated with cognitive behavioural therapy and/or the pain management program. After being seen as an outpatient in the pain clinic, a clinical assessment would be made and referred to the pain management program or psychology as appropriate. There are no fibro specialists, just pain specialists.</p>        </div>

          <p>Ambulance handovers at the LRI are a long-standing problem which have increased in size over the last six weeks. There are eight key reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Growing emergency attendance, admissions and EMAS conveyance (volume not %).</li>
<li>Increasing acuity of the patients accessing the emergency services.</li>
<li>Specific challenges with paediatric flow linked to acuity of patients presenting.</li>
<li>Poor estate and suboptimal capacity within ED to manage peaks in<br />demand.</li>
<li>No obvious locations to increase capacity near ED to manage<br />overflow.</li>
<li>Staffing numbers reduced by the agency cap.</li>
<li>Closure of base ward beds at LRI and GGH to support CQC work and<br />ICU reconfiguration.</li>
<li>Despite pressures reducing a little over the summer, staff have not really had a period of respite and are feeling very pressurised and tired.</li>
</ol>
<p>Working with partners across LLR, in particular EMAS, we have developed a series of actions to try and alleviate the key reasons above. Key actions taken include:</p>
<ol>
<li>EMAS and UHL bringing in consultancy support called Unipart to help standardize the process of handover between EMAS crews and UHL staff in the assessment bay. Their initial assessment is attached and WC 16 November 2015 is their fourth of eight weeks on site.</li>
<li>A joint LiA event between EMAS and UHL staff to identify and agree on the improvements required for a reduced handover time.</li>
<li>A detailed pan LLR action plan has been agreed to reduce admissions and attendance, improve flow and discharge. This is monitored via the fortnightly UCB.</li>
<li>A detailed UHL action plan, which is a subsection of the above is monitored through the emergency quality steering group and is attached.</li>
<li>The medical director and chief nurse have met with the paediatric ED team and wider paediatric team on three occasions in the last week to see what else can be done to support paediatric flow.</li>
<li>Adult and paediatric elective work at the LRI has been taken down to accommodate emergency activity. Recently there has also been a reduction in cancer work.</li>
<li>It has been agreed that the ED team can increase their nursing numbers from 25 qualified nurses per shift to above 30. This enables all the resus bays and assessment bays to be open and the overflow facility to be staffed. Unfortunately, since this change was made last week, we have not seen a fill rate over 25.</li>
<li>An area has been identified to cohort patients, for a short period of time, from majors ED who need to be admitted when there currently isn't a bed for them, but unfortunately due to UHL and EMAS staffing pressures we have been unable to open this.</li>
<li>We are working to re-open one adult bay and one paediatric bay at LRI, again because of staffing constraints, we have been unable to do this.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The time it is taking to handover some patients from EMAS crews to LRI staff is unacceptable. EMAS and UHL are clear about our joint responsibility for this and are working closely to try and rectify the many problems. Whilst focusing on improving the estate, staffing levels and handover process, we also need to be clear that we will continue to have a problem until emergency demands reduce.<br />W/e 16 November 2014 we had 4,195 patients through ED and UCC. W/e 15 November 2015 we had 4,724 patients through ED and UCC. This is a 12% increase or an additional 75 patients every day! If we were asked to care for an additional 75 patients every day last year we would have said it was impossible.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">What is the protocol for informing patients with cancer diagnosis? What is the cancer pathway once diagnosis has been made?</h3>

          <p class="Default">Most patients with suspected bladder cancer are referred through the 2-week wait via their GP’s who should tell them they are being referred with a ‘suspected’ cancer. They will then be sent an appointment for the haematuria clinic which has an accompanying booklet which explains the tests which includes the line:</p>
<p class="Default">‘You may want to bring a relative or friend to any appointments you have’</p>
<p class="Default">If a bladder tumour is found at that appointment the patient will be given the chance to see one of the Clinical Nurse Specialist team and also given the CNS contact details. They are given a further information leaflet about having the bladder tumour removed which also explains a little about bladder cancer and again suggests they bring a relative or friend to their follow-up appointment. It also explains the role of the key-worker and again includes the CNS contact details.</p>
<p class="Default">When the patient returns to clinic for their histology results they are again given the opportunity to see a CNS/Key-worker to discuss their results and explain their pathway from this point, a holistic needs assessment should be undertaken at this point.</p>
<p class="Default">The bladder cancer pathway following diagnosis will vary according to the grade and stage of their cancer, this could be anything from routine check cystoscopy (surveillance) to intra-vesicle bladder instillations to chemotherapy/ radiotherapy and cystectomy (removal of the bladder) The pathway is determined and individualised to each patient through the MDT meeting. </p>
<p class="Default">The MDT outcome is sent to the GP, there is a statement on the outcome that informs the GP that the patient may not be aware of their diagnosis in order to try to prevent the situation described in the question.</p>        </div>

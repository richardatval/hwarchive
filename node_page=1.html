  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Leicestershire Partnership Trust was funded to provide ten CAMHS inpatient beds at Oakham House. The service moved to Ward 3 Coalville Hospital in March 2015 and the same level of funding continued. With respect to future plans, LPT is currently exploring the long-term future for CAMHS inpatient service and discussing these with Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland stakeholders.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">I would like to know if any advances have been made in preventing those released from mental health care from frequently returning back to care because of the lack of support they have when released into the community, why is this not being addressed?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The aim of all of our community mental health services is to support people towards recovery by helping them to manage their mental health needs outside hospital, which is where most people prefer to be. Our community mental health services work with patients before, during and after hospital stays to do exactly this.</p>
<p>If someone is admitted to an acute ward, members of the community mental health team will work alongside ward staff and other agencies to ensure that their health and social needs are met once they are well enough to leave hospital so that any delays can be minimised.</p>
<p>If a patient leaving hospital is subject to the Care Plan Approach they will receive a follow-up contact (face to face wherever possible) within seven days of discharge, which is in line with national standards.<br />On going care will include outpatient appointments, involvement of a Community Psychiatric Nurse or Occupational Therapist and telephone support inside and out of hours. For people who need more intensive short-term support (this can be for a host of reasons) we have commissioned our partners, Richmond Fellowship to provide intensive but non-clinical residential support for up to seven nights as an alternative to admission.</p>
<p>Staff continues to work using the recovery approach, liaising closely with social care and other third sector agencies to support service users.</p>
<p>Our Recovery College, on the Glenfield Hospital site, enhances this support with a range of free recovery-focused courses, seminars and workshops for service users and their friends and family. The college has been co-produced and co-developed with people who use mental health services and a range of external organisations and services.</p>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>LPT is committed to engaging closely with the families of patients and service users, provided the patient or service user has agreed for information to be shared with them.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment to the Triangle of Care approach, carer engagement is documented as part of the patient records, which are audited weekly to ensure we have evidence that they have been involved in discussions around their loved one’s care plan. We also begin to plan for a return home at the earliest opportunity and discussions with families and carers is a key part of the process.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">What is the least intrusive method of caring for someone with mental health issues if they are a informal patient in a mental health hospital and when would it be necessary to detain them?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The lowest level of patient observation requires a member of ward staff to have the patient in their line of sight at least hourly. Patients are able to leave the ward unescorted dependent on their status of risk.</p>
<p>Observation levels are set based on a clinical assessment of the patient’s needs. This assessment includes their physical health needs, vulnerability, risk of self-harm and/or risk of unauthorised absence for the ward. This is discussed with the patient and reviewed at least daily.</p>
<p>Observation levels might be increased if the level of risk increases, for example to 15-minute checks or, at the highest level one member of staff would be required to keep the patient in line of sight constantly.</p>
<p>People who are admitted to an acute adult mental health ward as an informal patient do so on the basis that they agree to engage with us in terms of their care and any restrictions placed on them as part of their care plan. This is discussed with them as part of a detailed admissions process.</p>
<p>Patients also receive a ward pack which includes information on their rights and responsibilities as an informal inpatient, their rights if detained under the Mental Health Act and information about independent mental health advocates. These can be discussed in greater detail if the patient wishes, with their named nurse.</p>
<p>Detention under the Mental Health Act would be implemented only if the patient refused to engage in their care and was assessed as posing a real risk to themselves or others. </p>        </div>

          <p>The options for the longer term future location and capacity for inpatient CAMHS is currently being worked through. It is recognised nationally that there is insufficient capacity in the system currently and LPT are working with stakeholders, families and commissioners to determine an affordable solution.

          <p>Health Visitors have recently benefitted from a national investment programme and Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland now have 91 extra-qualified Health Visitors. The last students only qualified at the end of March and so the impact is just beginning to be felt by staff on the ground.</p>
<p>We have a multifaceted approach to improving health and wellbeing, with a new wellbeing zone on our staff website with an app for ease of access and use; LPT have supportive line management in place, stress awareness training for both managers and staff and a stress toolkit. Staff have access to a counselling service AMICA and we have introduced a new approach to help staff deal with the pressures of work called restorative supervision.</p>

          <p>We are pleased that dietetic input has been helpful, and agree it is essential for everyone to support and contribute to healthy eating.</p>
<p>The Nutrition and Dietetic Service works with schools in the city and county to provide advice on individual dietary modifications and school meals, where schools contract with the council to receive this service. Not all schools participate in this programme, and it may be that the particular school referred to is one which doesn’t. </p>
<p>We also provide support for schools relating to food and packed lunch policies. This project relates to general principles, rather than advice regarding individual children.</p>
<p>If it would be beneficial for a dietician to contact a school to discuss a specific nutritional issue with the relevant school staff, this could be arranged directly with the relevant dietician, or via the nutrition and dietetic service. </p>        </div>

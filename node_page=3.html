          <p>We fully accept that for all patients, and particularly those who have more than one condition or who are being cared for by more than one clinician either within UHL or across primary and secondary care, that it is important that information is shared between treating clinicians and with patients and their carers in a timely way.  </p>
<p>With this in mind, and in support of moving to our full electronic patient record, we have introduced systems that allow discharge and outpatient letters to be electronically sent to primary care clinicians using our ICE system. These electronic letters are also available for UHL clinicians to view through ICE.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our discharge letters are sent on the day of discharge using the ICE system but there are still delays in the time that it takes to type and approve outpatient letters and the Operations Directorate are currently undertaking a review of typing back-logs and approval delays to determine what more we can do to reduce these to our agreed standard of routine outpatient letters being received electronically by their primary care clinician within 10 working days.</p>        </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The CCTV system has been in place since the Loughborough Renal Unit opened in April 2002 as part of our commitment to safe care. The use of CCTV in the side rooms and waiting area is essential to patient safety as, due to the design of the side rooms, it is difficult to observe patients in these areas. We made a decision earlier this year, following advice from UHL Privacy Team and with the support of the UHL safeguarding team, to continue with the use of CCTV and have ensured that there are notices advising patients that CCTV is in use and the reasons why along with the details of who they should contact if they have any queries or concerns regarding this. These notices are clearly placed on both side room doors and within our waiting area. If a patient does have concerns and requests not to have CCTV we will offer alternative safe dialysis settings (e.g. non side room area) The CCTV is only in operation during the dialysis session as the unit is an outpatient facility. The CCTV system does not record and is in real time only. There is no auditory setting and is a visual safety aid only.</p>
<p>We are in the process of developing a capital bid to alter one of our side rooms into a high visibility isolation area, which in turn will reduce our requirement for CCTV in that area.</p>        </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>We are working with partners across LLR to ensure people have appropriate support at home. We hold a daily conference call in which all partners from social services are present and discharge discussed on an individual patient level. We also have a discharge response team funded by UHL who can offer support at home and bridge care packages.</p>
<p>The intensive community support service provides an intensive rehabilitation service to promote independence and recovery for people in the environment that they are most familiar with (i.e. their own home). The multidisciplinary service is advance nurse practitioner led, with medical input from the patient’s GP as required. The service aims to prevent or reduce the need for permanent or long-term care packages, by promoting, supporting and encouraging self-management.</p>
<p>The service is available to all suitable patients registered with a Leicester, Leicestershire or Rutland GP. It operates from 8.00am to 10.00pm every day of the year and patients receive up to four visits a day from the multi-disciplinary team of nurses, therapists and health care assistants who work closely with social care colleagues to ensure people receive coordinated and joined up care.</p>        </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Several members of staff within our Equality team are trained in creating easy read information. As part of a Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) this year we are building a library of easy information starting with the most common 10 ten procedures which will be available on the UHL website by the end of this fiscal year. In addition to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individually tailored easy read information will continue to be available where required as has been undertaken in the past few years.</li>
<li>The good communication standards from LPT are now starting to be shared as part of staff training sessions.</li>
<li>We now have a link Occupational Therapist for the therapies teams at Leicester Royal Infirmary for learning disabilities. We have met with them and any new publications around learning disabilities we share with them and they will share with the other therapists and upload to their shared drive so always available as required.</li>
<li>It is envisioned that the introduction of electronic patient records will also improve the flagging system highlighting an individual communication needs.</li>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>UHL runs a Specialist Multi-disciplinary Falls Service/ Clinic at LGH for City patients. GPs have full knowledge of this and regularly refer patients to the service. Referred patients are seen by a Consultant or Registrar and then discussed with therapists with onward reviews by therapists, investigations as deemed necessary. This includes advice on falls prevention and, potentially, enrolment on UHL’s Falls Prevention Programme.</p>
<p>Comparable services run in the County at Loughborough, Melton, Market Harborough, Oakham &amp; Hinckley. The Consultant input for these is provided by UHL but the Falls Prevention work &amp; therapy input is provided by the locality and is variable. Thus information about this can be obtained from these localities. </p>
<p>There is a piece of work underway at present to try and ‘revamp’ these services across Leicestershire to improve the services provided for the population of LLR.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Female genital mutilation (sometimes referred to as female circumcision) refers to procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice is illegal in the UK.</p>
<p>We provide a specialist clinic for women with FGM in Leicester i.e. the FGM clinic. Currently the referral pathway to this clinic is a) via the community midwife if pregnant, b) by the GP if not pregnant c) rarely by another specialist service e.g. GU or paediatrics if not pregnant.</p>
<p>Regarding training, there are regular teaching sessions for junior doctors at the Friday afternoon regional teaching. The junior doctors are encouraged to attend the FGM clinic. The midwives receive teaching at their mandatory training day. Workshops and teaching sessions have been provided for a mixture of social workers, teachers and health care workers within Leicestershire in conjunction with SAFE. There is also a UHL maternity guideline for FGM.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>All midwives have annual perinatal mental health training, it is mandatory, the programme for this is reviewed and updated annually to address new guidance and also to discuss any complaints, issues and case studies. There is a midwife employed with a special interest in perinatal mental Health and we have recently increased her hours so she can spend time on the wards supporting women with mental health problems and advising staff. She works closely with the perinatal mental Health team of community psychiatric nurses.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">Patient asks who is responsible for his referral to physiotherapy to be arranged in a timely manner knowing that starting a course of treatment soon after discharge from hospital could be vital to recovery?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>In general terms a patient coming through the elective orthopaedics wards at the Leicester General Hospital will be seen by the Physiotherapy team whilst on the ward and be given advice, exercises. walking aids and a stair assessment as necessary. Patients are encouraged to continue with their daily exercise programme/ walking practice once home while waiting for outpatient Physiotherapy to commence.</p>
<p>If a patient is coming in for a manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) they would be classed as requiring ‘Immediate’ outpatient follow up and would commence their outpatient Physiotherapy within the UHL standard of 3 days following discharge. The ward Physiotherapist will organise the outpatient Physiotherapy appointment and give this to the patient before they are discharged home.</p>
<p>All other knee surgery patients requiring outpatient Physiotherapy would be classed as an ‘Urgent’ referral and the local standard at the UHL is to see such patients within 10 days following discharge.</p>
<p>If a patient does not live within our catchment area and will be having their outpatient Physiotherapy follow up at another Leicestershire or Rutland Community hospital / base, the referral would be faxed on to that site. Although managed by a different Trust the Community service use a similar prioritisation scheme to that of the UHL. Where appropriate i.e. for a referral classed as ‘Immediate’ the UHL ward Physiotherapy staff will contact the community base to arrange the outpatient follow up appointment.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, it is unclear why a patient having elective knee surgery would have been advised that the wait for outpatient Physiotherapy could be 12 weeks or indeed who may have told them this.</p>        </div>
          </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">What happens with feedback submitted through the ‘Friends and Families Test’? Do you have any examples of how this has been used to improve any UHL services?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The Friends and Family Test (FFT) is used in many ways across the Trust to measure the responsiveness and effectiveness of services/ wards to respond to patients’ needs. Many Services collect the FFT in ‘real-time’ and therefore on either a daily or weekly basis FFT scores are monitored. If new initiatives or changes are implemented within clinical areas the FFT is used as a key measure in monitoring patient’s response to these changes.</p>
<p>Every wards success in meeting patient needs are monitored and the FFT is a core measure of a wards success monthly.  Each quarter an in depth review is undertaken of each ward using the ‘Ward Review Tool’ and this tool uses the FFT and a large number of the questions in the Patient Experience Survey to measure the wards outcomes.</p>
<p>Any wards that have very good FFT scores are asked to share patient comments as to why care was so good allowing other areas to learn. Also all areas with low FFT scores are closely monitored and reported to the Nursing Executive providing action plans for improvement.</p>
<p>Therefore there is a great deal of evidence illustrating how clinical staff actively listen and responded to the FFT scores by making improvements in care to meet the needs of people in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.</p>
<p>The FFT result is displayed on the Hot Boards on the entrance to wards and on the Trust website. ‘You Said, We Did’ charts are displayed on wards to identify what patients have said and what we have done towards making changes. </p>
<p>Examples of how feedback from the FFT has led to improvements can be found in ‘Celebrating Success’ and ‘Share Your Experience’ bulletins.  Also each quarter the Clinical Management Groups provide some examples of changes they have made in response to all feedback not just the FFT.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Penile sheath systems “Conveen” (Rochester Clear Advantage) are available via supplies for all UHL wards and all male patients are eligible to use them following assessment. NB Not all male patients may be suitable for a penile sheath system.</p>
<p>All wards have continence link nurses who are aware of the penile sheath system used on male wards. All new HCAs and RNs starting at UHL are taught how to assess and apply the sheaths plus drop-in sessions are held twice a year.</p>
<p>A discussion has been held in the past with the Infection Prevention team of the possibility of using the more specialised urinals in some ward areas on an individual patient basis. The idea would be for the patient to use the urinal on the ward taking the urinal home on discharge but Infection Prevention had concerns regarding the cleansing of the urinals between use &amp; therefore we couldn’t go ahead with this plan. Ward staff in areas such as Stroke Units, Neuro rehabilitation unit, stroke rehabilitation and orthopaedics are aware of the Beambridge specialised urinals and the Continence Team do have samples for patients to handle (but not use)– if we feel that any of these urinals would be useful for discharge, we arranged a supply via the GP.</p>

<p>The AFEX &amp; UROX systems are more specialised pieces of equipment of which there are many. It would be difficult for the Medical Professionals and for the general ward nurses to know about all of the equipment available. This type of equipment requires more specialised assessment and it can take time to find the right piece of equipment suitable for each person’s needs and abilities. Due to the AFEX &amp; UROX system not being disposable, cleansing within Infection Prevention protocol would be difficult. All wards are aware of the Continence Team and can refer inpatients to the team for bladder and bowel assessments. Usually if following assessment any specialised equipment is felt that it could be beneficial, the team provides advice and arranges further follow-up after discharge. </p>        </div>

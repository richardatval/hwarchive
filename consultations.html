          <p>Listed below are health and social care consultations happening in Leicestershire. These are your opportunities to have a say on the services provided for you.</p>

                  <div class="clearfix">
            <p>The public has a right to know how care services are performing. To help them to do this the Government has introduced a regulation requiring providers to display their Care Quality Commission (CQC) ratings. These ratings tell the public whether we think the care a service provides is outstanding, good, requires improvements or inadequate. Providers will need to display them on posters placed in areas such as waiting rooms, where they're clearly visible to the public.</p>

<p>The CQC would like to hear what you think of their guidance to help service providers meet a new requirement to display CQC ratings in their premises and online through their website (if they have one).</p>

<p>The consultation runs from Wednesday 28 January until Wednesday 25 February.</p>

                  <div class="clearfix">
            <p>Each of the Health and Wellbeing Boards in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland is working to produce local ‘Pharmaceutical Needs Assessments’ (PNAs), which will help ensure everyone living in this area has the right access to pharmacy services.</p>

<p>This questionnaire will help the three Health and Wellbeing Boards understand what people use community pharmacies for and how they feel about access to these pharmacies.  The questionnaire is asking about community pharmacies, including those in GP surgeries, and NOT about hospital pharmacies. This is a joint questionnaire between Leicestershire County Council, Rutland County Council and Leicester City Council. There will be a separate PNA for each area.</p>

<p>Community pharmacists (chemists) provide a range of health services, some funded by the NHS and some by local authorities. Every day about 1.6 million people visit a pharmacy in England.</p>

<p>By completing this questionnaire you are making sure that your views influence the services delivered from your local pharmacy.</p>

<p> The changes include things like: </p>

<ul>
	<li>what we look at on an inspection.</li>
	<li>how we judge what 'good' care looks like.</li>
	<li>how we rate care services to help you judge and choose care if you want to.</li>
	<li>how we use information to help us decide when and where we inspect.</li>

            <p>Care Quality Commissioner (CQC) want to hear about your experiences and knowledge of the help, care and support provided during a mental health crisis.</p>

<p>To help them understand more about the quality of local services, the CQC are carrying out a special review about the help, care and support that people receive when they experience a mental health crisis.</p>

<p>They would like to hear from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>people who have had personal experience of a mental health crisis and tried to get help for it in the last two years.</li>
	<li>people who have cared for others going through a crisis in the last two years.</li>
	<li>groups or organisations that work with people who have experienced a crisis and/or have an interest in the quality of crisis care in their local area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the areas they want to hear about include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the care received from GPs, hospitals, community mental health services or ambulances.</li>
	<li>the support given by other professionals during a crisis (such as the Police or Approved Mental Health Professionals).</li>

            <p>East Leicestershire and Rutland Clinical Commissioning Group (ELR CCG) are holding a number of events in an 8-week consultation to ask local residents their opinions on three options in a proposal to improve urgent care services.</p>

<p>Currently urgent care services differ in what is offered from place to place and opening times are confusing for patients and clinicians alike. Therefore ELR CCG has decided that there is room for significant improvement. It is also important that pressure is eased on busy A&amp;E departments and to ensure that local services provide consistently high quality and safe care.</p>

<p>The three options to consider, all of which include an urgent care centre in Market Harborough, Melton Mowbray, Oakham, and one in the Oadby and Wigston area, the exact location of which is to be decided. More information about the proposed options are detailed in the Healthwatch Leicestershire urgent care briefing below.</p>

            <p>East Leicestershire and Rutland Clinical Commissioning Group (ELR CCG) are holding a number of events in an 8-week consultation to ask local residents their opinions on three options in a proposal to improve urgent care services.</p>

<p>Currently urgent care services differ in what is offered from place to place and opening times are confusing for patients and clinicians alike. Therefore ELR CCG has decided that there is room for significant improvement. It is also important that pressure is eased on busy A&amp;E departments and to ensure that local services provide consistently high quality and safe care.<br />
<br />
The three options to consider, all of which include an urgent care centre in Market Harborough, Melton Mowbray, Oakham, and one in the Oadby and Wigston area, the exact location of which is to be decided. More information about the proposed options are detailed in the Healthwatch Leicestershire urgent care briefing below.</p>

            <p>West Leicestershire Clinical Commissiong Group (WL CCG) and Leicestershire Partnership Trust (LPT) are inviting local people to have their say on proposals that will make Ashby community health services fit for the future.</p>
<p>The proposals suggest two options for the future of services available from Ashby and District Hospital. The Leicester Road hospital site is in need of major repair and is currently underused as many local people travel to Burton for their hospital treatment.</p>
<p>Public health figures estimate that the population aged over 65 will increase from 62,000 (in 2011) to 82,000 by 2021. Older people are generally in need of more healthcare and NHS managers fear that the hospital does not have the capacity to cope with the increased demand.</p>
<p>The first option of closing the hospital would see budgets previously earmarked to repair the hospital used to fund extra nurses and invested in providing more services to care for local people in their own homes.</p>
<p>The second option of keeping the hospital open would see services remain the same, with some additional outpatient clinics added. Between £500,000 and £900,000 would need to be invested in essential repairs.</p>
<p><strong>Two events are being held on 5 March 2014, the first from 2:30pm - 4pm and the second from 6:30pm - 8pm.</strong></p>          </div>

<p>Healthwatch England (HWE) has launched a 12 week strategy consultation with patients, care users and their families, which will shape HWE's strategy over the next two years.</p>

<p>The consutlation aims to find out what people expect from the services they need and use these to challenge services to do more to meet public expectation.</p>

<p>HWE plans to pay special attention to those groups rarely heard, such as children and young people and those with mental health conditions.</p>

<p>The consultation will consist of a number of nationwide events and an extensive outreach programme to capture thoughts and feelings from people all over the country.</p>

<p>This consultation provides those who actually use services with an opportunity to comment at an early stage in the development of a more consumer focused health and social care service.</p>

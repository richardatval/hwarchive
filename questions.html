          <p>We can confirm that nurses do have DBS checks. </p>
<p>Evidence of right to work in UK and we ask for three forms of different identity documents one of which must be photo evidence and at least one proof of current address.</p>
<p>Based on the evidence provided we request the barring lists to be checked depending on where they are being appointed to. The remaining information needed is obtained during the electronic application process e.g. previous addresses, name. The application form asks about any convictions, cautions etc, the mandatory questions also ask the same and we make notes of the information disclosed at interview.</p>
<p>All preferred candidates fill in a declaration which asks about convictions and there is a section for a full explanation to be given.</p>
<p>If the disclosure comes back with information on it about previous history a form is sent to the candidate for details, which will be presented to a Disclosure panel.</p>
<p>The panel consists of a senior clinical member of staff, a HR representative, a member of senior management and a HR Lead or above.</p>
<p>The incident and candidates comments are discussed and the references read. A decision is then made whether the person would be suitable for the role. If there are any concerns or the candidate is to be turned down a record is made. All candidates are issued with a letter to advise the outcome of the meeting. These meetings are held once a month.</p>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">How does LPT staff raise concerns about other members of staff? Is there any support for them?  Is this reflected in any policies by LPT?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Staff have a number of routes through which they can raise concerns about other staff and they are supported to do so. Full details are included in the Whistleblowing Policy and all staff also have a 'credit card' that lists all the various routes to raise issues as well as sources of support for staff including Amica (staff counselling), anti-bullying helpline, Trade Unions etc.</p>
<p>This information is also included in the staff handbook. We ask staff in our annual survey and in our quarterly FFT/Pulse surveys if they know how to raise concerns and whether they would be happy to do so. Results of the most recent FFT/Pulse Survey (Sept 2015) indicate that 95% of staff know how to raise concerns and 85% would feel secure to do so.</p>
<p>This is significantly higher than the national average (and the LPT average) reported in the 2014 National Staff Survey. As part of the Sir Robert Francis 'Freedom to Speak Up report, we have developed an e-learning package to raise awareness amongst staff of how to raise concerns and we will be appointing a 'Guardian' who will be another source of support for staff who have concerns about patient care.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>How does LPT encourage patients to put a complaint through if they feel are being treated badly?</p>
<p>The importance of supporting people to make complaints is first addressed during staff corporate induction. Each service encourages their patients/carers to complain by displaying posters and leaflets advising how they can make a complaint. Our LPT website also contains advice on how to put forward a complaint.</p>
<p>Following the last CQC visit the complaint process has been completely redesigned with help and advice from representatives from Healthwatch. The complaints leaflet has been redesigned and we have also launched a complainant satisfaction survey so that we can gain an understanding of patients' experience of making complaints to learn and further improve.</p>
<p>We endeavour to comply with NHSLA guidance that complaints do not go into case records, which should help to alleviate patients anxiety around feeling discriminated against. We also give the complainant a choice of where the response is sent to e.g. if the complainant is a current inpatient they can choose whether the response is sent to home or the ward.</p>
<p>Our PALS service offers patients/carers help and support independent of the service they may have a concern with and patient/carer leaflets with PALS contact details on are widely available.</p>
<p>When we acknowledge complaints we make patients/carers aware of the POhWER NHS complaints advocacy service which is independent of LPT - the following line is taken from the acknowledgement letter sent to the complainant:</p>
<p>The Trust would like to assure you that your care will not be compromised as a result of you making a complaint. If you are concerned, at any point in the process, that your care has been adversely affected as a result of you raising your concerns please contact the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS). You will find enclosed a copy of our Complaints and PALS leaflets and an NHS Complaints Advocacy leaflet for your information.</p>
<p>Verbal complaint forms are available on the intranet and internet that allow anyone to make a complaint, supported by staff if required.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">What is being done about the shortage of Mental Health Nurses and shortage of beds? What is the future for the CAMHS unit at Coalville hospital?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>On 24 March 2015, the CAMHS In-patient unit known as Oakham House formally closed. The closure was the final part of the LPT Towers Site land sale agreement that had been made with Redrow Housing, who were the purchasers and developers of the site.</p>
<p>On 24 March, young people who had been patients at Oakham House, were transferred to a newly refurbished in-patient facility at Ward 3, Coalville Community Hospital.</p>
<p>The move from Oakham House to Ward 3 Coalville, was a like to like move for a temporary period, with existing provision for 10 patients in dormitory style accommodation continuing to be provided.</p>
<p>To facilitate the transfer of services from Oakham House to Ward 3 Coalville, the project team worked closely with LPT Communications team to ensure all stakeholders were informed regularly of the move. This included updates on the trust website, local radio and written communication to key stakeholders. Young people and families who were patients at Oakham House were kept informed of the room regularly through ward rounds, and through printed documents such as floor plans and mock up designs of rooms being hung up in the communal areas in Oakham House. An open day was held on Friday 20th March 2015, where families, carers, partners from Local Authority, Police,0 40EMAS, Healthwatch and Coalville Hospital Patients Forum were in attendance.</p>
<p>We are sorry if the family concerned did not feel they were adequately informed of the move. We recognised the importance of keeping open Oakham House for admissions prior to the move to limit the number of young people being placed out of area, and we are sorry if that during the initial stay at Oakham House, the move was not clearly shared with the young person and their family.</p>
<p>We recognise that Ward 3 at Coalville is limited in certain aspects of provision, namely that the refurbishment was unable to provide single ensuite bedrooms, which we know, is something young people and their families feel is important. The clinical team, work hard to ensure that the privacy of the young person is respected within the confines of their treatment, and young people have reported they welcome the support they get from their peers on the ward.</p>
<p>In November 2014 the All Party Parliamentary Review on CAMHS In-patient beds published a health enquiry following a review of the provision of CAMHS in-patient beds across England and Wales. This enquiry noted that there were insufficient beds for the demand. NHS England who are responsible for the commissioning of CAMHS beds having been reviewing provision, and are planning to commence procurement process in 2016 to ensure sufficient bed provision is available. We work hard with other clinical CAMHS in-providers within the East Midlands to ensure we regularly share our occupancy levels, and with the national bed management tool this aids us within identifying beds that are closer to home if we are unable to accommodate at Ward 3.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">If a patient is suffering from agoraphobia (extreme or irrational fear of open or public places) how can they access medication if their GP refuses to write them a prescription? Can they be referred to a community team? What are the processes?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>It is difficult to give a full response without further information to understand why the GP might feel it inappropriate to prescribe further medication or to make a home visit, and no knowledge of whether the GP and patient have communicated via telephone.</p>
<p>We can say that if the patient is already open to our services they can request a home visit from a member of our team by contacting their mental healthcare professional or via their GP. They could then be assessed for possible referral for CBT to support them with their agoraphobia. A referral to the specialist service can be made by their LPT healthcare professional or their GP.</p>
<p>If they are not already open to our services they could make a request that the GP refer them to community mental health services for assessment.</p>        </div>

          <p>The Young Onset Dementia Assessment Service (YODAS) which replaces Younger Person's Memory Service (YPMS) within the Mental Health Service for Older People (MHSOP), commenced in March 2015. YODAS offers a specialised, hospital-based assessment service for people under the age of 65 years with cognitive impairment and/or memory problems, suspected to be due to a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The service is aimed to provide a specialist diagnostic assessment service, clinic-based, for people between the ages of 40 and 65, presenting with cognitive problems, suspected to be due to a dementia. Following assessment and diagnosis, the care of the patients will be transferred to the locality MHSOP memory services or CMHT for cholinesterase inhibitors or other pharmacological intervention and further clinical inputs, if they have progressive dementia. Those with mild cognitive impairment and non-progressive conditions will be discharged back to primary care. People with any underlying medical or psychiatric disorders other than dementia will be referred back to respective services for further treatment.</p>        </div>

          <p>The Crisis Service will provide assessment and treatment to adults (16 and over) who are experiencing a severe mental health problem with an acute crisis of such severity that, without the involvement of a Crisis Service, automatic hospitalisation would be necessary. There would be a breakdown of normal coping strategies, which may affect social, physical and emotional function.</p>
<p>We provide a home treatment service to people using a range of therapeutic and treatment options as appropriate based on individual need.</p>
<p>These can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety management</li>
<li>Aspects of problem solving</li>
<li>Sleep hygiene</li>
<li>Challenging negative thoughts</li>
<li>Development of recovery plans</li>

<li>Medication education</li>
<li>Occupational therapy (provided by trained OT staff working in the crisis team)</li>
<li>Social care (provided by trained social workers working in the crisis team)</li>

A further assessment may be undertaken if the patient presents as particularly unwell. The mental health practitioner will then arrange the most appropriate course of action for this patient which maybe GP support, home treatment from the crisis team or admission to an inpatient unit.</p>        </div>

          <p>Through the Equality impact assessments and equality analysis are you able to demonstrate a robust approach to equality</p>
<p>The Trust has a dedicated resource for undertaking Due Regard process (equality impact assessments).</p>
<p>Due Regard (equality analysis) is the mechanism by which the Trust seeks to ensure that its functions, policies, processes and practices do not have an adverse impact on any person described in the Equality Act 2010; age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex (gender) and sexual orientation, as well as those not listed.</p>
<p>The Public Sector Equality Duty seeks to simplify the process. The aim is to reduce bureaucracy whilst seeking to ensure that organisations consider the three aims of the Equality Duty as an integral part of decision making in respect of service and employment policy, practice and process changes.</p>
<p>These three aims are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act</li>
<li>Advance equality of opportunity between people of the same group and people from different groups; and</li>
<li>Foster good relations between people of the same group and people from different groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due Regard will be used as a tool to help the Trust make fair, sound and transparent decisions that are based on a robust understanding of the needs and rights of the groups and individuals who access our services or are in employment with the Trust. LPT has developed a rigorous due regard process.</p>
<p>There are two stages to the due regard process, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part A Initial screening template (complete this to identify whether a full Equality Analysis is required)</li>
<li>Part B Full analysis must be undertaken if identified following the initial screening process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Equality team will provide support, guidance and advice to managers on the Due Regard process. We also have resources available to support staff such as the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow chart</li>
<li>Fact sheet</li>
<li>Templates</li>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The aim of all of our community mental health services is to support people towards recovery by helping them to manage their mental health needs outside hospital, which is where most people prefer to be. Our community mental health services work with patients before, during and after hospital stays to do exactly this.</p>
<p>If someone is admitted to an acute ward, members of the community mental health team will work alongside ward staff and other agencies to ensure that their health and social needs are met once they are well enough to leave hospital so that any delays can be minimised.</p>
<p>If a patient leaving hospital is subject to the Care Plan Approach they will receive a follow-up contact (face to face wherever possible) within seven days of discharge, which is in line with national standards.<br />On going care will include outpatient appointments, involvement of a Community Psychiatric Nurse or Occupational Therapist and telephone support inside and out of hours. For people who need more intensive short-term support (this can be for a host of reasons) we have commissioned our partners, Richmond Fellowship to provide intensive but non-clinical residential support for up to seven nights as an alternative to admission.</p>
<p>Staff continues to work using the recovery approach, liaising closely with social care and other third sector agencies to support service users.</p>
<p>Our Recovery College, on the Glenfield Hospital site, enhances this support with a range of free recovery-focused courses, seminars and workshops for service users and their friends and family. The college has been co-produced and co-developed with people who use mental health services and a range of external organisations and services.</p>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The lowest level of patient observation requires a member of ward staff to have the patient in their line of sight at least hourly. Patients are able to leave the ward unescorted dependent on their status of risk.</p>
<p>Observation levels are set based on a clinical assessment of the patient’s needs. This assessment includes their physical health needs, vulnerability, risk of self-harm and/or risk of unauthorised absence for the ward. This is discussed with the patient and reviewed at least daily.</p>
<p>Observation levels might be increased if the level of risk increases, for example to 15-minute checks or, at the highest level one member of staff would be required to keep the patient in line of sight constantly.</p>
<p>People who are admitted to an acute adult mental health ward as an informal patient do so on the basis that they agree to engage with us in terms of their care and any restrictions placed on them as part of their care plan. This is discussed with them as part of a detailed admissions process.</p>
<p>Patients also receive a ward pack which includes information on their rights and responsibilities as an informal inpatient, their rights if detained under the Mental Health Act and information about independent mental health advocates. These can be discussed in greater detail if the patient wishes, with their named nurse.</p>
<p>Detention under the Mental Health Act would be implemented only if the patient refused to engage in their care and was assessed as posing a real risk to themselves or others. </p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Children’s services within Leicestershire Partnership Trust have never been commissioned to provide sensory integration therapy, which is a specific form of assessment and treatment for people with sensory processing difficulties. Sensory integration is normally provided by therapists’ predominantly occupational therapists. In order to practice you need to have attended an accredited post graduate course, completion at the highest level is a Masters qualification. Currently the service has 2 fully qualified therapists and 4 who have the basic requirement. </p>
<p>General sensory assessments have been completed (and still are) to assist with differential diagnosis in both the CAMHS services and Occupational Therapy Service.</p>
<p>In 2011/2012 the Occupational Therapy Service requested additional funding to deliver a sensory integration service and the commissioners initiated a consultation period including a stakeholder event.  At the end of this consultation the request for additional funding was rejected and the following statement was issued by the commissioners:</p>
<p>STATEMENT ON SENSORY PROCESSING DIFFICULTIES AND SENSORY INTEGRATION THERAPY</p>
<p>FAMILY, YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN CLINICAL SUB-GROUP</p>
<p>The Family, Young People and Children Clinical Sub-Group has considered a request to commission sensory integration therapy from Leicestershire Partnership Trust. The Group has investigated the research evidence for this therapy and received representations from clinicians and parents.</p>
<p>The Group has concluded that there is insufficient evidence that sensory integration therapy is a clinically effective intervention which should be commissioned as a stand-alone service. This is based on a review of research evidence including analysis conducted by the American Academy of Paediatrics in 2011.</p>
<p>Sensory integration therapy has never been commissioned by health services in Leicester City, Leicestershire or Rutland. Health services do commission an occupational therapy service for children and young people based on national guidance, local need and financial constraint.</p>
<p>December 2012</p>
<p>Following this consultation the Occupational Therapy Service decided that they would be able to provide advice to families, where sensory processing difficulties affecting every day function were identified or suspected that would support families finding their own strategies to support the child.  After consultation with parents it was decided that a parent workshop would be useful.  Parent workshops have been delivered and developed based on feedback from parents and now consists of a 3-hour workshop delivered to 12 parents at a time.  Each family is offered 2 places. We currently deliver 3 sessions a month and on average support 24 children.  At the end of the session the families receive a pack of information including 2 books that are specially imported from America that are written for parents to support their child.  After 8 weeks of following these strategies parents are offered the opportunity to phone in to talk to a therapist who will be able to offer further advice.</p>
<p>If at any point a child is identified who would benefit from the mainstream Occupational Therapy Service then this service is offered and may include a detailed assessment, individual or group therapy, school visit or the provision of equipment.</p>        </div>

<p>Most of our resource is directed to the acute children and young people who are seen on the day of referral or urgent cases who receive an assessment within 2 weeks. Some children, who have been screened as meeting the criteria for a routine assessment, wait from between 13 weeks to a maximum of 44 weeks to be seen. This means that on average a child waits around 8 weeks to be seen. </p>
<p>Criteria for acceptance of a referral into specialist CAMHS is specific, and includes psychiatric presentation. We are the only service for patients with diagnosable mental illness, and must prioritise this function.</p>

It has been noticeable during that last 18 months that some areas of counselling provision have been decommissioned e.g. Open Door in the City. In other areas such as Loughborough, school based projects such as Worth-it have been established to provide counselling support for students. School nurses will be able to signpost young people to their local early help offer. GP’s can also advise/refer for counselling. </p>

              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The dietetic service is funded and resourced to provide a service Monday to Friday with core hours being 9am to 5pm, dietetic staff work flexibly between 8am and 8pm Monday to Friday to meet patient and service needs e.g. early morning and evening Multi Disciplinary Team outpatient clinics, early morning and evening board rounds and also undertake a lot of work in the evenings and weekends with local patient support groups e.g. diabetes coeliac, cancer, Gastrointestinal disease.</p>
<p>We are not aware of any near misses, incidents or complaints linked to there being no dietetic service provision at the weekends to date. A lot of ward Dieticians will leave care plans for weekends predicting patient journeys and progress and work late on Fridays to do this.</p>
<p>We have identified with adult surgery – cancer cases that with a Saturday service post ward rounds we could help with more effective discharge and we are working with the Clinical Management team to identify resource needs for this.</p>
<p>As part of working towards 7 day working we have undertaken a granular level review of the need for weekend working at speciality and sub speciality level and working with each Clinical Management Group on this.</p>
<p>We have also worked with other Trusts Dietetic Services to look at their experiences in implementing 7 days services and some have more recently reported that this has destabilised their service overall with time owed being taken in core service delivery time reducing patient care in critical areas such as gastroenterology and renal where the dietician is core to the Multi Disciplinary Team.</p>
<p>We looked closely at provision of weekend and bank holiday dietetic services over this Christmas and New year and concluded we would not put any in as time owed would be taken in the weeks following in January when peak patient activity was expected. On review of this decision with all dietetic staff in the new year this was the correct decision and no patient care was compromised.</p>
<p>We continue to keep this issue under review and have prioritised the need to develop clinical guidelines and policies for all health care professionals in nutrition and diet care and provide training as well to support their use in the clinical areas.</p>        </div>

          <p>The majority of patients that are seen by the Learning Disability (LD) Service are in fact admitted during the week and within working hours. This is on average 3 new patients per day Mon - Friday. Out of hours admissions are less than this. Any patient admitted over the weekend or after 5pm is identified by the team via our flagging system which is checked daily. The care of the patient and level of support required is prioritised according to their particular needs.</p>
<p>Once the initial needs assessment is carried out ward staff manage a significant number of patients with a learning disability without needing on going daily support from the specialist team.</p>
<p>A major part of the role of the Acute Liaison Nurses has been to work closely with ward staff and share their expertise to enable all staff to provide the appropriate care to patients with a learning disability in the initial phase of their patient journey. The team do provide staff training throughout the year.</p>
<p>There is a specific needs assessment document that we ask patients / carers who have a learning disability to complete and bring with them when they come into hospital (The traffic Light Assessment and Emergency Grab Sheet). These documents include basic information about the individual requirements of the patients i.e. preferred method of communication, dietary needs, medication, sources of anxiety etc. This is enormously helpful for ward staff and enables them to provide the appropriate support that the patient needs.</p>
<p>The staffing resource for the service remains under review and with the advent of 7 day working the Trust will revisit the level of service provision.</p>
<p>If service users and or carers feel that they haven't had sufficient access to the Acute Liaison Nurse Service because the admission occurred out of hours the Manager of the service would be keen to hear from you.</p>

<p>Fibromyalgia is a neurological diagnosis that comes from many sources not usually diagnosed in the pain clinic. Usually diagnosed by the rheumatology service where leaflets are given. No specific information is given in the pain clinic.</p>
<p>It is a diagnosis of exclusion where all other pain, joint pain, back etc. are ruled out. At this point the patient can be referred to pain clinic after being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>If a patient was referred to the pain service without a diagnosis but had wide spread joint pain the service would discharge to rheumatology for tests and diagnosis.</p>
<p>Once within the pain service a patient with a fibromyalgia diagnosis is prescribed medication, which would typically be pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine etc. whilst avoiding opiates. Intravenous lidocaine infusions were tried in the past, however this was found to have no long term benefits.</p>
<p>There is no cure and very few medications show success. Fibromyalgia is usually treated with cognitive behavioural therapy and/or the pain management program. After being seen as an outpatient in the pain clinic, a clinical assessment would be made and referred to the pain management program or psychology as appropriate. There are no fibro specialists, just pain specialists.</p>        </div>

      <h3 class="accordion-header">Ambulance handover times - Is there yet any sign of improvement?</h3>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Ambulance handovers at the LRI are a long-standing problem which have increased in size over the last six weeks. There are eight key reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Growing emergency attendance, admissions and EMAS conveyance (volume not %).</li>
<li>Increasing acuity of the patients accessing the emergency services.</li>
<li>Specific challenges with paediatric flow linked to acuity of patients presenting.</li>
<li>Poor estate and suboptimal capacity within ED to manage peaks in<br />demand.</li>
<li>No obvious locations to increase capacity near ED to manage<br />overflow.</li>
<li>Staffing numbers reduced by the agency cap.</li>
<li>Closure of base ward beds at LRI and GGH to support CQC work and<br />ICU reconfiguration.</li>
<li>Despite pressures reducing a little over the summer, staff have not really had a period of respite and are feeling very pressurised and tired.</li>
</ol>
<p>Working with partners across LLR, in particular EMAS, we have developed a series of actions to try and alleviate the key reasons above. Key actions taken include:</p>
<ol>
<li>EMAS and UHL bringing in consultancy support called Unipart to help standardize the process of handover between EMAS crews and UHL staff in the assessment bay. Their initial assessment is attached and WC 16 November 2015 is their fourth of eight weeks on site.</li>
<li>A joint LiA event between EMAS and UHL staff to identify and agree on the improvements required for a reduced handover time.</li>
<li>A detailed pan LLR action plan has been agreed to reduce admissions and attendance, improve flow and discharge. This is monitored via the fortnightly UCB.</li>
<li>A detailed UHL action plan, which is a subsection of the above is monitored through the emergency quality steering group and is attached.</li>
<li>The medical director and chief nurse have met with the paediatric ED team and wider paediatric team on three occasions in the last week to see what else can be done to support paediatric flow.</li>
<li>Adult and paediatric elective work at the LRI has been taken down to accommodate emergency activity. Recently there has also been a reduction in cancer work.</li>
<li>It has been agreed that the ED team can increase their nursing numbers from 25 qualified nurses per shift to above 30. This enables all the resus bays and assessment bays to be open and the overflow facility to be staffed. Unfortunately, since this change was made last week, we have not seen a fill rate over 25.</li>
<li>An area has been identified to cohort patients, for a short period of time, from majors ED who need to be admitted when there currently isn't a bed for them, but unfortunately due to UHL and EMAS staffing pressures we have been unable to open this.</li>
<li>We are working to re-open one adult bay and one paediatric bay at LRI, again because of staffing constraints, we have been unable to do this.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The time it is taking to handover some patients from EMAS crews to LRI staff is unacceptable. EMAS and UHL are clear about our joint responsibility for this and are working closely to try and rectify the many problems. Whilst focusing on improving the estate, staffing levels and handover process, we also need to be clear that we will continue to have a problem until emergency demands reduce.<br />W/e 16 November 2014 we had 4,195 patients through ED and UCC. W/e 15 November 2015 we had 4,724 patients through ED and UCC. This is a 12% increase or an additional 75 patients every day! If we were asked to care for an additional 75 patients every day last year we would have said it was impossible.</p>        </div>

              <div class="clearfix">
          <p class="Default">Most patients with suspected bladder cancer are referred through the 2-week wait via their GP’s who should tell them they are being referred with a ‘suspected’ cancer. They will then be sent an appointment for the haematuria clinic which has an accompanying booklet which explains the tests which includes the line:</p>
<p class="Default">‘You may want to bring a relative or friend to any appointments you have’</p>
<p class="Default">If a bladder tumour is found at that appointment the patient will be given the chance to see one of the Clinical Nurse Specialist team and also given the CNS contact details. They are given a further information leaflet about having the bladder tumour removed which also explains a little about bladder cancer and again suggests they bring a relative or friend to their follow-up appointment. It also explains the role of the key-worker and again includes the CNS contact details.</p>
<p class="Default">When the patient returns to clinic for their histology results they are again given the opportunity to see a CNS/Key-worker to discuss their results and explain their pathway from this point, a holistic needs assessment should be undertaken at this point.</p>
<p class="Default">The bladder cancer pathway following diagnosis will vary according to the grade and stage of their cancer, this could be anything from routine check cystoscopy (surveillance) to intra-vesicle bladder instillations to chemotherapy/ radiotherapy and cystectomy (removal of the bladder) The pathway is determined and individualised to each patient through the MDT meeting. </p>
<p class="Default">The MDT outcome is sent to the GP, there is a statement on the outcome that informs the GP that the patient may not be aware of their diagnosis in order to try to prevent the situation described in the question.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>We fully accept that for all patients, and particularly those who have more than one condition or who are being cared for by more than one clinician either within UHL or across primary and secondary care, that it is important that information is shared between treating clinicians and with patients and their carers in a timely way.  </p>
<p>With this in mind, and in support of moving to our full electronic patient record, we have introduced systems that allow discharge and outpatient letters to be electronically sent to primary care clinicians using our ICE system. These electronic letters are also available for UHL clinicians to view through ICE.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our discharge letters are sent on the day of discharge using the ICE system but there are still delays in the time that it takes to type and approve outpatient letters and the Operations Directorate are currently undertaking a review of typing back-logs and approval delays to determine what more we can do to reduce these to our agreed standard of routine outpatient letters being received electronically by their primary care clinician within 10 working days.</p>        </div>

          <p>The CCTV system has been in place since the Loughborough Renal Unit opened in April 2002 as part of our commitment to safe care. The use of CCTV in the side rooms and waiting area is essential to patient safety as, due to the design of the side rooms, it is difficult to observe patients in these areas. We made a decision earlier this year, following advice from UHL Privacy Team and with the support of the UHL safeguarding team, to continue with the use of CCTV and have ensured that there are notices advising patients that CCTV is in use and the reasons why along with the details of who they should contact if they have any queries or concerns regarding this. These notices are clearly placed on both side room doors and within our waiting area. If a patient does have concerns and requests not to have CCTV we will offer alternative safe dialysis settings (e.g. non side room area) The CCTV is only in operation during the dialysis session as the unit is an outpatient facility. The CCTV system does not record and is in real time only. There is no auditory setting and is a visual safety aid only.</p>
<p>We are in the process of developing a capital bid to alter one of our side rooms into a high visibility isolation area, which in turn will reduce our requirement for CCTV in that area.</p>        </div>

          <p>We are working with partners across LLR to ensure people have appropriate support at home. We hold a daily conference call in which all partners from social services are present and discharge discussed on an individual patient level. We also have a discharge response team funded by UHL who can offer support at home and bridge care packages.</p>
<p>The intensive community support service provides an intensive rehabilitation service to promote independence and recovery for people in the environment that they are most familiar with (i.e. their own home). The multidisciplinary service is advance nurse practitioner led, with medical input from the patient’s GP as required. The service aims to prevent or reduce the need for permanent or long-term care packages, by promoting, supporting and encouraging self-management.</p>
<p>The service is available to all suitable patients registered with a Leicester, Leicestershire or Rutland GP. It operates from 8.00am to 10.00pm every day of the year and patients receive up to four visits a day from the multi-disciplinary team of nurses, therapists and health care assistants who work closely with social care colleagues to ensure people receive coordinated and joined up care.</p>        </div>

In addition to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individually tailored easy read information will continue to be available where required as has been undertaken in the past few years.</li>
<li>The good communication standards from LPT are now starting to be shared as part of staff training sessions.</li>
<li>We now have a link Occupational Therapist for the therapies teams at Leicester Royal Infirmary for learning disabilities.

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>UHL runs a Specialist Multi-disciplinary Falls Service/ Clinic at LGH for City patients. GPs have full knowledge of this and regularly refer patients to the service. Referred patients are seen by a Consultant or Registrar and then discussed with therapists with onward reviews by therapists, investigations as deemed necessary. This includes advice on falls prevention and, potentially, enrolment on UHL’s Falls Prevention Programme.</p>
<p>Comparable services run in the County at Loughborough, Melton, Market Harborough, Oakham &amp; Hinckley. The Consultant input for these is provided by UHL but the Falls Prevention work &amp; therapy input is provided by the locality and is variable. Thus information about this can be obtained from these localities. </p>
<p>There is a piece of work underway at present to try and ‘revamp’ these services across Leicestershire to improve the services provided for the population of LLR.</p>        </div>

    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>Female genital mutilation (sometimes referred to as female circumcision) refers to procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice is illegal in the UK.</p>
<p>We provide a specialist clinic for women with FGM in Leicester i.e. the FGM clinic. Currently the referral pathway to this clinic is a) via the community midwife if pregnant, b) by the GP if not pregnant c) rarely by another specialist service e.g. GU or paediatrics if not pregnant.</p>
<p>Regarding training, there are regular teaching sessions for junior doctors at the Friday afternoon regional teaching. The junior doctors are encouraged to attend the FGM clinic. The midwives receive teaching at their mandatory training day. Workshops and teaching sessions have been provided for a mixture of social workers, teachers and health care workers within Leicestershire in conjunction with SAFE. There is also a UHL maternity guideline for FGM.</p>        </div>

There is a midwife employed with a special interest in perinatal mental Health and we have recently increased her hours so she can spend time on the wards supporting women with mental health problems and advising staff.

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>In general terms a patient coming through the elective orthopaedics wards at the Leicester General Hospital will be seen by the Physiotherapy team whilst on the ward and be given advice, exercises. walking aids and a stair assessment as necessary. Patients are encouraged to continue with their daily exercise programme/ walking practice once home while waiting for outpatient Physiotherapy to commence.</p>
<p>If a patient is coming in for a manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) they would be classed as requiring ‘Immediate’ outpatient follow up and would commence their outpatient Physiotherapy within the UHL standard of 3 days following discharge. The ward Physiotherapist will organise the outpatient Physiotherapy appointment and give this to the patient before they are discharged home.</p>
<p>All other knee surgery patients requiring outpatient Physiotherapy would be classed as an ‘Urgent’ referral and the local standard at the UHL is to see such patients within 10 days following discharge.</p>
<p>If a patient does not live within our catchment area and will be having their outpatient Physiotherapy follow up at another Leicestershire or Rutland Community hospital / base, the referral would be faxed on to that site. Although managed by a different Trust the Community service use a similar prioritisation scheme to that of the UHL. Where appropriate i.e. for a referral classed as ‘Immediate’ the UHL ward Physiotherapy staff will contact the community base to arrange the outpatient follow up appointment.</p>
<p>With the above in mind, it is unclear why a patient having elective knee surgery would have been advised that the wait for outpatient Physiotherapy could be 12 weeks or indeed who may have told them this.</p>        </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The Friends and Family Test (FFT) is used in many ways across the Trust to measure the responsiveness and effectiveness of services/ wards to respond to patients’ needs. Many Services collect the FFT in ‘real-time’ and therefore on either a daily or weekly basis FFT scores are monitored. If new initiatives or changes are implemented within clinical areas the FFT is used as a key measure in monitoring patient’s response to these changes.</p>
<p>Every wards success in meeting patient needs are monitored and the FFT is a core measure of a wards success monthly.  Each quarter an in depth review is undertaken of each ward using the ‘Ward Review Tool’ and this tool uses the FFT and a large number of the questions in the Patient Experience Survey to measure the wards outcomes.</p>
<p>Any wards that have very good FFT scores are asked to share patient comments as to why care was so good allowing other areas to learn. Also all areas with low FFT scores are closely monitored and reported to the Nursing Executive providing action plans for improvement.</p>
<p>Therefore there is a great deal of evidence illustrating how clinical staff actively listen and responded to the FFT scores by making improvements in care to meet the needs of people in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland.</p>
<p>The FFT result is displayed on the Hot Boards on the entrance to wards and on the Trust website. ‘You Said, We Did’ charts are displayed on wards to identify what patients have said and what we have done towards making changes. </p>
<p>Examples of how feedback from the FFT has led to improvements can be found in ‘Celebrating Success’ and ‘Share Your Experience’ bulletins.  Also each quarter the Clinical Management Groups provide some examples of changes they have made in response to all feedback not just the FFT.</p>        </div>

          <p>Penile sheath systems “Conveen” (Rochester Clear Advantage) are available via supplies for all UHL wards and all male patients are eligible to use them following assessment. NB Not all male patients may be suitable for a penile sheath system.</p>
<p>All wards have continence link nurses who are aware of the penile sheath system used on male wards. All new HCAs and RNs starting at UHL are taught how to assess and apply the sheaths plus drop-in sessions are held twice a year.</p>
<p>A discussion has been held in the past with the Infection Prevention team of the possibility of using the more specialised urinals in some ward areas on an individual patient basis. The idea would be for the patient to use the urinal on the ward taking the urinal home on discharge but Infection Prevention had concerns regarding the cleansing of the urinals between use &amp; therefore we couldn’t go ahead with this plan. Ward staff in areas such as Stroke Units, Neuro rehabilitation unit, stroke rehabilitation and orthopaedics are aware of the Beambridge specialised urinals and the Continence Team do have samples for patients to handle (but not use)– if we feel that any of these urinals would be useful for discharge, we arranged a supply via the GP.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The AFEX &amp; UROX systems are more specialised pieces of equipment of which there are many. It would be difficult for the Medical Professionals and for the general ward nurses to know about all of the equipment available. This type of equipment requires more specialised assessment and it can take time to find the right piece of equipment suitable for each person’s needs and abilities. Due to the AFEX &amp; UROX system not being disposable, cleansing within Infection Prevention protocol would be difficult. All wards are aware of the Continence Team and can refer inpatients to the team for bladder and bowel assessments. Usually if following assessment any specialised equipment is felt that it could be beneficial, the team provides advice and arranges further follow-up after discharge. </p>        </div>

          <p>Patient has been a regular user of the Bone Density Scanner at LRI, which has allowed her to monitor her low bone density, which was diagnosed 20 years previously. The patient suffered an early menopause at 42 years. After booking herself a bone scan she discovered she was suffering from osteopenia, which prompted the beginning of preventative treatment. After many years of using the bone density scanner followed by diagnosis and treatment the patient felt able to enjoy her life with grandchildren, husband and friends. Patient is extremely disappointed that the bone-scanning department has been closed.</p>

<p>Following the removal of the Bone Density Scanner patients are referred to the Rheumatology department by their GP. The results from tests with the consultant are less detailed, in comparison to results from the Bone Density Scanner. To confirm, the Bone Density Scanner (Dexa) has not moved location, patients cannot pay a fee to use the machine, but the service remains unchanged, it is still available for patients and so no necessity to inform them. To note, we have a new Scanner which will be put in place shortly, this is to replace the existing scanner, this will not affect patients and the scanner will still be available.</p>

              <div class="clearfix">
          <p>The Support Services manager at Shuttlewood Clarke Foundation is part of the Fibromyalgia Friends Together group in Leicestershire. As part of their discussion the members of the group spoke about their wish to have a service where they can have help and receive advice over the telephone by a Fibromyalgia specialist. They would also like a specialist clinic.</p>
<p>Healthwatch Leicestershire has recently conducted a priorities survey. From a draft analysis of the data a number of respondents spoke about the need for a Fibromyalgia clinic within Leicestershire and some form of support system.   </p>
<p>We offer a service for chronic pain patients to access our chronic pain nurses - not specifically for fibromyalgia, but they will ring patients back and do telephone consultations.</p>
<p>Fibromyalgia is a neurological diagnosis that comes from many sources not usually diagnosed in the pain clinic. Usually diagnosed by the rheumatology service where leaflets are given. No specific information is given in the pain clinic. </p>
<p>It is a diagnosis of exclusion where all other pain, joint pain, back etc. are ruled out. At this point the patient can be referred to pain clinic after being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.<br />
If a patient was referred to the pain service without a diagnosis but had wide spread joint pain the service would discharge to rheumatology for tests and diagnosis. </p>
<p>Once within the pain service a patient with a fibromyalgia diagnosis is prescribed medication which would typically be pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine etc. whilst avoiding opiates. Intravenous lidocaine infusions were tried in the past, however this was found to have no long term benefits.</p>
<p>There is no cure and very few medications show success. Fibromyalgia is usually treated with cognitive behavioural therapy and/or the pain management program. After being seen as an outpatient in the pain clinic, a clinical assessment would be made and referred to the pain management program or psychology as appropriate. There are no fibro specialists, just pain specialists.</p>

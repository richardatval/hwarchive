    <h1>CQC publish their report following June 2016 inspection of Leicester’s Hospitals</h1>
    <p>30/01/2017</p>
          <div class="clearfix">
        <p><span>Following its inspection of the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust in June 2016, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) has today (Thursday 26 January 2017) published its findings.</span></p>
<p>John Adler, Leicester’s Hospitals Chief Executive said: “When the CQC arrived in June (20th) to inspect our organisation we told them that our biggest strength was our staff; their strong motivation, commitment and ambition to improve our services for our patients and for each other. </p>
<p>“The CQC saw this for themselves and it was echoed in their feedback.  They told us that they found our staff to be “universally welcoming, open and transparent” and they were clearly very impressed by the compassion, professionalism and loyalty of everyone they encountered. This is reflected in the fact that “Caring” has been rated “Good” across all three hospital sites.</p>
<p>“We were also honest with the CQC about the challenges that we face.  We told them that we are steadily improving quality whilst dealing with large increases in demand.  That we were working better with our partners to tackle longstanding strategic issues such as emergency care, and that along the way we were building a more empowered culture.  All these things are reflected in the CQC report.”</p>
<p>The report said “Although the overall rating we gave the trust in this inspection was the same as they were awarded in their 2014 inspection, we did find improvements had been made.  These were particularly evident in staff engagement and confidence in the leadership team.”</p>
<p>Since our first inspection in 2014, when we were one of the first Trusts to be inspected using this methodology, the bar has been significantly raised with the current inspections taking a more thorough and forensic look at services.</p>
<p>The CQC team inspected eight core services across our three hospitals.  The CQC rated the Trust overall, as 'Requires Improvement’; Rating the Royal Infirmary, the General and the Glenfield Hospitals all individually as ‘Requires Improvement’.  Of the 100 ratings in total (for each domain of each main service grouping), 1 is Outstanding (for the effectiveness of our East Midlands Congenital Heart service at Glenfield), 55 are Good, 41 are Requires Improvement and 1 is Inadequate (the Responsive domain of emergency care at the Royal).  Two elements were unrated for technical reasons.</p>
<p>We were particularly pleased that the CQC judged our East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre (which is under threat of decommissioning by NHS England) to be “Good” overall, with 4 domains “Good” and 1 “Outstanding”.</p>
<p>Julie Smith, Chief Nurse at Leicester’s Hospitals said: “Throughout the reports were examples of good practice that the CQC had witnessed during their time with us.  We are of course proud of these and for the staff for openly sharing them with the inspectors.</p>
<p>“Of course there are areas where we need to improve, which we will be picking up through our action plan which we need to submit by 16 February 2017.” </p>
<p>Andrew Furlong, Medical Director at Leicester’s Hospitals added: “When the inspectors were with us we already had in place an enforcement action given to us in November 2015 following an unannounced CQC visit to our adult Emergency Department.  On 15 November 2016 that enforcement action was lifted after inspectors were assured that we had made improvements to ensure that staff in the department had the appropriate mix of skills to treat the patients arriving, that patients received an appropriate clinical assessment by a qualified member of staff within 15 minutes of arriving, and that patients received the right care and treatment in line with our sepsis clinical pathway.” </p>
<p>Finally, Chief Executive John Adler added: “The reports highlight some areas where we need to improve further.  Our Outpatient clinics were highlighted and last summer as part of our Quality Commitment we began a piece of work to improve our processes in outpatients and the experience of patients being seen in those clinics.  We still have more to do, but are already seeing improvements.</p>
<p>“Overall, we think that the CQC’s assessment is accurate, balanced and fair.  We are now in the process of developing an action plan which maps out the improvements we’ll continue to make based on the CQC’s findings and we will post information about these on our website over the coming months.”</p>      </div>
